# NWB Schnitzer Lab

`mat2nwb` converts Schnitzer lab MATLAB datafiles to NWB. 

To function properly, this code requires the following packages: 
 - YAMLMATLAB: https://github.com/ewiger/yamlmatlab
 - MATNWB: https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/matnwb
 
 This code was written and tested on MATLAB R2019b, compatability will vary for other versions.
 
 To execude the code use the command `mat2nwb` in MATLAB command window. 
 For basic function no other commands are required, and you will be prompted for any additional
 info. 
 
 Alternatively, the following parameters may be used:
 
 `matnwb('yamlpath','/examplepath/examplefile.yml')`:  manually input the location of the metadata
 yaml file. 
 
 `matnwb('datapath','/examplepath/examplefile.mat')`: manually input the location of the matlab
 data files. This code was developed and tested with the following file naming conventions:
 
 *_cnmfAnalysis.mat
 
 *_cnmfeAnalysis.mat
 
 *_extractAnalysis.mat
 
 *_emAnalysis.mat
 
 Other datafiles may not be compatible
 
 `matnwb('nwbpath','/examplepath/examplefile.nwb')`: manually enter the name and location of the
 resulting NWB file.

`extract_nwb_data.m` is a basic example function that extracts data from NWB file back to the matlab format.
